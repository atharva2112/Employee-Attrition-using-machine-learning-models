# Employee-Attrition-using-machine-learning-models
This project is about predicting employee attrition using machine learning models. We will explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights using visualization techniques. Then, we will train various ML models to predict employee attrition and select the best one. Finally, we will deploy the model as a web app using the Dash framework.

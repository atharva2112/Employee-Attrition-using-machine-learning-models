# Employee-Attrition-using-machine-learning-models
This project is about predicting employee attrition using machine learning models. We will explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights using visualization techniques. Then, we will train various ML models to predict employee attrition and select the best one. Finally, we will deploy the model as a web app using the Dash framework.
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition, and provide insights on factors that influence employee retention. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation. The final model can be used to predict employee attrition and provide recommendations for employee retention strategies.
This project successfully builds a machine learning model to predict employee attrition and provides insights on factors that influence employee retention. The visualizations provided by the web app can be used by HR managers and other stakeholders to identify areas for improvement in employee retention strategies.
